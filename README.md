## **SLAM DEMO PROJECTS**  

The work of this project shows the step of implementing various SLAM algorithms on the offiline Lidar data. Please see Readme.md in each project for third-party software and implementation details.



[**Extended Kalman Filter**](./EKF_Slam), work included  
	* Full matrix update  
	* Sparse matrix update

[**Particle Filter Landmark**](./PF_FastSlam_Lmk), work included  
	* Data association using landmarks extracted from Lidar data  

[**Particle Filter Scan-matching**](./PF_FastSlam_GridMap), work included  
    	* Data association using Binary scan-matching   
	* Gripmap likelihood probability for a map reconstruction 

[**Online Graph Filter**](./OnlineGraphSlam), work included  
	* Udacity AI landmark sim [here](./OnlineGraphSlam/UdacityAI_Project)  
    	* Raw Lidar and Robot motion post-processing [here](./OnlineGraphSlam/RawLidar_Project)
