## **SLAM DEMO PROJECTS**  

The work of this project shows the step of implementing Extended Kalman Filter and Particle Filter for SLAM. Please see Readme.md in each project for third-party software and implementation details.



[**Extended Kalman Filter**](./EKF_Slam), work included  
	* Basic full matrix update  
	* Sparse matrix update

[**Particle Filter**](./PF_FastSlamGridMap), work included  
	* Basic landmark feature data association  
    	* Gripmap likelihood probability data association
