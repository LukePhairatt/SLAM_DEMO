The following python codes has been implemented from Udacity AI course- Graph SLAM

- OnlineSLAM_FixSize.py
- OnlineSLAM_DynamicSize.py

I am using seperate X,Y information matrix and vector to the problem. It is given the same result.
In addition, I am trying it with dynamic expansion of the matrices to simulate SLAM idea.
It allocates/expands the matrix for a new motion/landmark measurement as commonly used in SLAM...
